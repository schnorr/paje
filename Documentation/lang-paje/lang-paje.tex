\begin{abstract}
  
  Pajé is an interactive and scalable trace-based visualization tool
  which can be used for a large variety of visualizations including
  performance monitoring of parallel applications, monitoring the
  execution of processors in a large scale PC cluster or representing
  the behavior of distributed applications. Users of Pajé can tailor
  the visualization to their needs, without having to know any insight
  nor to modify any component of Pajé. This can be done by defining
  the type hierarchy of objects to be visualized as well as how these
  objects should be visualized. This feature allows the use of Pajé
  for a wide variety of visualizations such as the use of resources by
  applications in a large-size cluster or the behavior of distributed
  Java applications.  This report describes the trace format used by
  Pajé. Traces include three different kind of informations:
  definition of the formats of the event, definition of the type
  hierarchy of the objects to be visualized, definition of the formats
  of the events of the trace and a set of recorded events, complying
  with the format definition, to be used to build visualizations
  according to the type hierarchy.

 \textbf{Keywords:} performance debugging, visualization, MPI, pthread, 
parallel programming, self defined data format.
