    * General/PajeType.[mh],
      PajeSimulator/PajeSimul+Events.m
      PajeSimulator/PajeSimul.m: bugfix, multiple types with same name
      are correctly managed by the simulator. Types were used as keys
      in the userEntities dictionary, but their hashes were the name,
      and not the unique identifier of the type (an optional alias).
      This commit addresses this issue by creating a new attribute to
      the PajeType that corresponds to the alias defined in the trace
      or the name (if alias not present). PajeTypes' hash is based
      on this new attribute.

2010-12-15  Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
    * Paje/Paje.gorm/*: bugfix, changing the selected filter on popup updates
      the current filter of the "Filter" window

2010-11-24  Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
    * FileReader/PajeFileReader.[hm]: method to obtain the porcentage
      of the trace file that has already been read.

2010-07-13  Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
    * FileReader/PajeFileReader.[hm], General/Protocols.h: let the user
      specify the chunk size used during the reading of a trace file.

2010-07-01  Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
    * General/PajeFilter.[hm], StorageController/AnchorFilter.m: fixing the
      return type for the protocol method containerTypeForType (it was
      PajeEntityType, but it always return PajeContainerType).
    * Removed some compilation warnings

2010-03-10  Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
    * PajeSimulator/SimulContainer.[mh]: maxValueForEntityType and
      minValueForEntityType were returning NSNumber* instead of double (as
      defined by the PajeFilter protocol).

2010-02-23  Benhur Stein <benhur@inf.ufsm.br>
    * Documentation/lang-paje/typeevent.tex, PajeSimulator/PajeSimul+Events.m,
      PajeSimulator/PajeSimul.m: some code cleanup; change the way aliases
      work: now, if an alias is defined, all references must be to the alias,
      they cannot be to the name anymore. This allows for different entities
      to have the same name when in a different container.

2009-12-23 Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
    * Tracers/JRastro/libRastro/*: using autotools (automake, ...) to create a

      the tracefile

2009-09-23 Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
    * PajeSimulator/PajeSimul+Events.m,PajeSimul.m,SimulContainer.[h|m]:
      changes to make containers keep extra fields when specified in
      PajeCreateContainer events in the trace file. The SimulContainer class
      now has an attribute extraFields and two new methods to intercept
      queries about fields (fieldNames and valueOfFieldnamed:)

2006-10-29  Benhur Stein <benhur@inf.ufsm.br>
	* */*: rewrote file reading and simulation for better speed.
          (events are kept pointing into original string from file;
          events cannot be retained anymore;
          fields are made into objects only when needed, by the simulator).
          new AggregatingFilter, with some code from StorageController;
          completed missing entity types (values); still needing some
          refactoring.
          made distinction between -value and -doubleValue for all entity types.

2006-10-29  Benhur Stein <benhur@inf.ufsm.br>
	* SpaceTimeDiagram/*: major overhaul in drawing code, mainly to
	  substitute PS functions by NSBezierPath.
	  variables now have a vertical scale; all variables use the same
	  scale in a container.

2006-06-24  Benhur Stein <benhur@inf.ufsm.br>
        * StorageController/AggregateEvent.m: get startTime and endTime of
          entity to aggregate separetely (for when it is already an aggregation)
        * StorageController/AggregatingChunkArray.[hm]: new initialisation
          method that returns a subclass depending on entityType;
          new AggregatingEventChunkArray subclass;
          in aggregateEntitiesUntilTime:, try to aggregate entities at end, when
          there is an interval without entities just before time.
        * StorageController/Encapsulate.m: use new initialisation method;
          support for aggregating events as well as states
        * StorageController/EventAggregator.[hm]: new method aggregateBefore:;
          take into account possibility of aggregated events have different
          start and end times (when already aggregated).

2006-06-22  Benhur Stein <benhur@inf.ufsm.br>
	* StorageController/AggregatingChunkArray.[hm]: refactored to define
	  private subclasses for each entity type
	* StorageController/Encapsulate.m: use new interface to AggChArr.

2006-06-20  Benhur Stein <benhur@inf.ufsm.br>
        * PajeSimulator/UserEvent.[hm]: -setEvent: new method
        * PajeSimulator/UserLink.[hm]: remove direct access to event ivar
        * StorageController/EventAggregator.[hm]: changed maxDuration to
          aggregationDuration; added a new initialization method; refactored
          some methods; changed to agglomerate events added in increasing
          date; added copyWithZone: method
        * StorageController/StateAggregator.[hm]: some refactoring;
          changed aggregation to work with states being added in increasing 
          endTime order; added copyWithZone: method
        * StorageController/AggregateState.m: get entities in reverse order
        * StorageController/AggregatingChunkArray.[hm]: new class
        * StorageController/GNUmakefile: include new class
        * General/ChunkArray.[hm]: new method for enumeration of only completed
          entities, necessary for state aggregation; chunks are now ordered
          by startTime; send notification when accessing an empty chunk (chunks
          are no longer removed, they are emptied)
        * StorageController/Encapsulate.[hm]: Most functionality removed -- no
          longer enumerates entities, enumeration is now done directly by
          containers. New code for controlling aggregation of states. 
          This will eventually go into a new filter.
        * EntityChunk.[hm]: chunks can be emptied. A chunk keeps its state.
          Three new methods to change state (-freeze, -activate, -empty).
          The class keeps a list in LRU order of all chunks, to be emptied by
          controller. New enumerators for accessing data in forward or reverse
          order (forward enums needed by agglomerators). Some methods from
          SimulChunk migrated to here.
        * General/EntityDescriptor.h: add missing newline at end of file.
        * EntityTypeFilter/EntityTypeSelector.m: change method decl
        * General/FilteredEnumerator.m: -nextObject rewriten
        * General/MultiEnumerator.[hm]: new initializer
        * General/PSortedArray.[hm]: new auxiliary methods (lastObject,
          indexOfFirstObjectAfterValue:, indexOfLastObjectBeforeValue:)
        * General/PajeContainer.[hm]: declare new enumeration methods
        * Paje/PajeController.[hm]: new method -bundleWithName: for loading/
          keeping track of loaded bundles
        * Paje/PajeTraceController.[hm]: new way of loading/connecting bundles,
          following a config structure (still fixed, should be read from
          a config file); remove code for checkpointing, now all info needed
          for resimulation is kept by containers, indexed by "chunkNumber";
          reading of each chunk is started by calling startChunk:, components
          must know how to restart a chunk;
          new support for conversion of time into chunkNumber.
        * many files: removed encode/decodeCheckPointWithCoder: method
        * PajeEventDecoder.[hm]: keep info for each chunk;
          implement -startChunk: and endOfChunk; some cleaning on -init.
        * PajeFileReader.[hm]: same thing; change class name to FileReader
        * PajeSimulator/PajeSimul.[hm]: same thing; 
        * PajeSimulator/PajeSimul+Events.m: some optimizations for when
          simulation is being replayed
        * General/Protocols.h: add -startChunk: and -endOfChunk methods
        * PajeSimulator/SimulChunk.[hm]: some methods refactored into super;
          implement simulation of each entity event here (from SimulContainer);
          better error for illegal events (in wrong entity type).
          Each chunk now keeps the entities that finish in its lifetime
          (those are freed when the chunk is emptied) and entities that
          exist during its lifetime but finish after it (those are never
          freed and are used for resimulating). AggregateStateChunk: new
          subclass to help with aggregation of states (should not be here).
          still needs some refactoring and better implementation of 'variable'
          entities.
        * SimulContainer.[hm]: methods for reverse/forward enumeration of
          entities; moved most of entity simulation into SimulChunk.
        * General/PajeFilter.[hm]: declare new methods -startChunk:,
          -endOfChunk,
          -enumeratorOfCompleteEntitiesTyped:inContainer:fromTime:toTime:
          minDuration:

        * SpaceTimeViewer/STEntityTypeLayout.[hm]: declare and implement
          accessors for minValue and maxValue (for storing limits of graph)
	* SpaceTimeViewer/STEntityTypeLayout.gorm: added a new Form for
          max & min values of variables; 
        * SpaceTimeViewer/STEntityTypeLayoutController.[mh]: make use of new

	  filter that selects entities based on values of some of its fields.

2005-01-05  Benhur Stein <benhur@inf.ufsm.br>
	* General/PajeEntity.m: added -duration method (returns elapsed time
	  of entity); added "StartTime", "EndTime" and "Duration" named fields
	* General/PajeType.h: added new instance variable "fieldNames" to
	  hold all known names of fields of entities of a type.

	  names of fields.
	* ReductionFilter/ReduceEntityType.m: also initialize new variable
	  (this class does not use initialization code from superclass)
	* StorageController/Encapsulate.m: implement -fieldNamesForEntityType:
	  so that a filter can have access to names of fields;
	  add a temporary solution to garantee that an entity type has
	  access to all names (make it see all entities - ugly)
	* ReductionFilter/ReduceEntity.m: likewise, even uglier!

2005-01-05  Benhur Stein <benhur@inf.ufsm.br>
	* SpaceTimeViewer/DrawView+Drawing.m: changed way of drawing values
